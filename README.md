# Pyautogui_LoL_Samira_Combo
A little fun personal project learning how to use Python scripts/Pyautogui

## A little context for this project 
Samira is a character from League of Legends who was heavily influenced by another game character, Dante from Devil May Cry. Both characters use combos that are ranked in the order of D, C, B, A, S (S being the best) depending on how well you execute your combos. I wanted to merge to the two characters even more; therefore, I brought the sound effects from Devil May Cry and made it play upon seeing the screen for each combo ranking when I played Samira. Just a little fun thing to practice using Python scripts and using one of my favorite games, League of Legends!
